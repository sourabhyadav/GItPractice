2nd file

User 1: Git bash -> here user 1 can commit the changes personally
User 2: Git bash -> here user 2 can commit the changes personally

Git Server -> to collaborate between user 1 and user 2. This can be achieved by using git push and git pull command and git branch and merge stuff
	- the server is nothing but github website which is protected by username and password for each user
	


adding any file is a two step process:
working copy ->  stagin area   ->    repository  ->   git server
	     add	      commit		 push

// Rolling for older version
1st commit >> 2nd commit >> 3rd commit >> 2nd commit (this is roll back to prev version)
// here in git we kind of never delete any commit rather we go in linear fasion
