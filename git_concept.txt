2nd file

adding any file is a two step process:
working copy ->  stagin area   ->    repository  ->   git server
	     add	      commit		 push

// Rolling for older version
1st commit >> 2nd commit >> 3rd commit >> 2nd commit (this is roll back to prev version)
// here in git we kind of never delete any commit rather we go in linear fasion
